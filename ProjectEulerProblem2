# Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers

'''
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
'''

oldFib = 1
Fib = 2
newFib = 0
sum = 2

while newFib < 4000000 :
	newFib = oldFib + Fib
	oldFib = Fib
	Fib = newFib
	if Fib%2 == 0:
		sum = sum + Fib
		
print "Answer: ",sum
